What is express?

express is the framework of nodejs which is used for managing servers and routes better.it is faster,unopinionated(we can customize it)and minimalist(we have to write less lines of code here).

for creating a express server,first we have to import express by using the require() method.then define a port number for the server.for sending the json data to server,we are using JSON.stringify().we are ending the specific routes by res.end() which means that we are telling server that this particular request has been fulfilled.
